  statement: 'Creating innovative and scalable solutions through technology', 
  about: "I am a recent graduate from UC Berkeley with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, where I cultivated a passion for problem-solving, innovation, and lifelong learning. Outside the world of coding and technology, fitness is an essential part of my routine, helping me stay focused and energized. I also love playing guitar. When I'm not working on personal projects or pursuing my professional goals, I spend quality time with my two dogs, Yarpi and Yukka. Yarpi is a charming Pug-Shih Tzu mix, while Yukka is a Pomeranian. I am driven by curiosity and the desire to learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact. Whether it's taking on challenging projects, exploring new technologies, or finding creative solutions, I embrace every opportunity to push boundaries and expand my horizons."
